# MechanicalBach

This project is a neural network which composes piano music. The three models weree trained by the following dataset: https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro#download

## Background 

This project compares three different models' (a GAN, an LSTM, and a Transformer) performance in being trained and ability to compose original music. Each neural network is trained on the Maestro dataset, and the trained models can then 'compose' original pieces of classical piano. 

## Running the code 

As the code is parametrized, only `training.py` and `generate.py` need to be run and the choice of models and hyperparameters can be chosen from the command line.
